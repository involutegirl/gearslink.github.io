### Shimo Shurijin (she/her)

# *"Just you wait - ShiShu Designs will be known from here to home!"*

While many can sew, mend, or cobble, the Shurijin family of Doma practices a distinct and singularly important trade: The care for and maintenance of the vessels of Kami. Shimo Shurijin takes to the family trade gleefully from a young age. Despite bearing the name of a winter's frost for her exceptionally pale skin, Shimo is anything but cold!

When word of the Garlean war of succession renews revolutionary ferver in occupied Doma, a Shimo of but sixteen summers is sent away to the far-flung shores of Eorzea. Where she had hoped to find common ground amongst Ul'dah's lovers of fineries and relics, however, Shimo finds little more than sand and hunger, being summarily branded yet another refugee.

For a time, the young Au'ra gets by sewing and mending for other refugees, but she gets a lucky break when a call for refugee workers brings her into the employ of the Weavers' Guild. There, Shimo hones her craft and makes a name for herself in her new home, all the while working towards her ultimate goal: Establishing her very own Doma and Ul'dah-inspired fashion boutique!
